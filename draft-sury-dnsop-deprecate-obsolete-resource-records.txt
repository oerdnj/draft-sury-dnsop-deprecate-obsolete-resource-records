1.  Introduction

   [RFC1035] and other documents have defined some Resource Record (RR)
   Types that are no longer in common use.  Some of these have been
   rendered obsolete by subsequent standards, but were never clearly
   deprecated.  In some cases there have been interoperability problems
   between DNS implementations that supported these types and those that
   did not: for example, because of DNS name compression in the wire
   format.  Continued support for these RR Types imposes a complexity
   cost on new implementations for little benefit.

   This document formally deprecates such RR Types, allowing
   implementations to drop specific support for them.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Deprecating MD, MF, MB, MG, MR, MINFO, MAILA, and MAILB RR Types

   The MD, MF, MB, MG, MR, MINFO, MAILA, and MAILB RR Types are not used
   in any existing standards.  This document deprecates their usage.

   The MD, MF, MB, MG, MR, and MINFO RR Types contain domain names in
   their RDATA.  DNS compression MUST NOT be applied to these domain
   names when sending.

   As an update to [RFC3597] and [RFC4034] this document specifies that
   for MD, MF, MB, MG, MR, and MINFO RR types, the canonical form such
   that they do NOT include downcasing of embedded domain names.

   Canonical forms otherwise remain as specified in Section 6.2 of
   [RFC4034].

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document updates the IANA registry "Domain Name System (DNS)
   Parameters" ([DNS-IANA]) as follows:

              +-------+-------+------------+---------------+
              | TYPE  | Value | Meaning    | Reference     |
              +=======+=======+============+===============+
              | MD    | 3     | DEPRECATED | This document |
              +-------+-------+------------+---------------+
              | MF    | 4     | DEPRECATED | This document |
              +-------+-------+------------+---------------+
              | MB    | 7     | DEPRECATED | This document |
              +-------+-------+------------+---------------+
              | MG    | 8     | DEPRECATED | This document |
              +-------+-------+------------+---------------+
              | MR    | 9     | DEPRECATED | This document |
              +-------+-------+------------+---------------+
              | MINFO | 14    | DEPRECATED | This document |
              +-------+-------+------------+---------------+
              | MAILB | 253   | DEPRECATED | This document |
              +-------+-------+------------+---------------+
              | MAILA | 254   | DEPRECATED | This document |
              +-------+-------+------------+---------------+

4.  Implementation Considerations

   Obsolete types will be flagged as DEPRECATED in the IANA registry,
   and the following guidance is given to DNS implementors in the
   handling of these RR types:

   1.  Authoritative DNS Servers SHOULD issue a warning when loading
       zones that contain DEPRECATED RR Types;

   2.  DNS Servers MUST NOT compress RDATA when rendering DEPRECATED RR
       Types to wire format;

   3.  Recursive DNS Servers MAY support legacy compression in
       DEPRECATED RR Types for received data for backward compatibility
       if desired, but SHOULD warn if such information is received.
       Compressed RDATA in DEPRECATED RR Types MUST be uncompressed
       before sending, and MUST NOT be re-transmitted in compressed
       form;

   4.  DNS Clients which receive DEPRECATED RR Types MAY interpret them
       as unknown RR Types ([RFC3597]), and MUST NOT interfere with
       their transmission;

   5.  DNSSEC Validators and Signers SHOULD treat RDATA for DEPRECATED
       RR Types as opaque with respect to canonical RR ordering and
       deduplication;

5.  Security Considerations

   This document has no security considerations.

6.  Operational Considerations

   Varying states of implementation of MD, MF, MB, MG, MR, and MINFO RR
   Types have already caused operational problems between DNS
   implementations that did, and did not, implement them, as a result of
   different behavior with resepect to DNS compression on the wire.
   This document aims to rectify the situation by encourating removal of
   support for all these RR Types in DNS implementations.  This should
   cause few if any operational problems, because these types are not in
   common use on the internet.

   Considerations section.
